# React Todo App

This is a simple react todo app done step-by-step.

- The user can create its own todo list and add new task by adding the task in input tab.
- As soon as one task is added the count of active tasks is increaded by 1 and is shown at the bottom of the list.
- Once the task is completed by the user, the user can click on the chekbox and mark the task as completed and item count is decreaded by one from total active item list.The task will apprear as crossed(as shown in the below image).
- We can view all tasks active or completed on the homw page and can alos view all active and completed tasks separately.
- User can also serch any task using the serch bar.
- Special buttons are also given at the buttom of the todo list window to disbale/enable user from additin or searching any task.

Shortcuts:

- We can disable/enable search bar using shortcut keys like esc to discable and entring / to enable.
- Similarly, we can locak the user from adding in new tasks(using esc key) and then enable them to add new tasks using(N).
